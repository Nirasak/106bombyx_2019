Let’s call xi the number of the i'th generation of butterflys. Here is a model for the evolution of xi:  
(x1 = n where n is the number of first generation individuals  
 xi+1 = kxi * (1000−xi) / 1000, for i ≥ 1, k being the growth rate, from 1 to 4.

In order to study this evolution, you are asked to plot two things:  
• The curve representing the number of individuals in relation to the generation (varying from 1 to 100);  
• A synthetic scheme summing all the results for a given n; it consists in plotting every value of xi
(between two given bounds), in relation to k (k varying from 1 to 4 by 0.01 steps).

In both cases, your program shall print on the standard outuput the values to be entered into gnuplot to
draw the graphs.

#### Usage
